This tool operates <strong>100% in your browser</strong>. When you paste HTML to compare versions, <strong>nothing is uploaded, transmitted, logged, or stored anywhere</strong>. This Privacy Policy confirms our complete commitment to data protection.</p> <h2>We Collect Absolutely Nothing</h2> <p>We do not collect, store, or process any form of personal data. This includes:</p> <ul><li><strong>HTML content</strong> you paste or compare</li> <li><strong>IP addresses</strong>, browser fingerprints, or location data</li> <li><strong>Usage statistics</strong>, session information, or analytics</li> <li><strong>Cookies</strong>, localStorage persistence, or tracking pixels</li></ul> <p>All diff calculations happen exclusively on your device using JavaScript. When you close the tab, everything disappears forever.</p> <h2>How the Tool Works</h2> <p>The entire comparison engine — powered by <em>diff2html</em> and <em>jsdiff</em> — runs locally. Even if you disable internet access completely, the tool continues to function perfectly. You can verify this yourself: open Developer Tools → Network tab → no requests are made after page load.</p> <h2>No Third-Party Services</h2> <p>We do not use analytics (Google Analytics, Plausible, etc.), advertising networks, error reporting tools, or external fonts that could track you. The only external resources are optional CDN-hosted Bootstrap CSS/JS (which contain no tracking) and the open-source diff libraries bundled locally.</p> <h2>Security & Offline Use</h2> <p>Because no data ever leaves your browser, the tool is safe for:</p> <ul><li>Proprietary templates and internal documentation</li> <li>Pre-release designs and client deliverables</li> <li>Sensitive administrative interfaces</li> <li>Any HTML containing confidential information</li></ul> <h2>Children's Privacy</h2> <p>Our service is not directed to children under 13. Since we collect no data, we do not knowingly process information from children.</p> <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2> <p>We may update this policy only if we add server-side features (which we have no plans to do). Any changes will be clearly dated at the top of this page.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-7ke6fz"><strong>Your data stays yours — always.</strong> This is not a marketing claim. It is verifiable architecture.</p></article></div>`);function M(d){var e=T();b("7ke6fz",y=>{var r=P(),h=u(g(r),6);t(4),s(()=>l(h,"content",`${c??""}/privacy`)),m(()=>{v.title="Privacy Policy • AxelBase HTML Difference Highlighter"}),a(y,r)});var o=i(e),f=i(o);t(4),n(o),t(2),n(e),s(()=>l(f,"href",`${c??""}/`)),a(d,e)}export{M as component,A as universal};
