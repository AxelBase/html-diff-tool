Source code, internal documentation, pre-release designs, and client deliverables often contain confidential information that should never leave your control.</p> <p>AxelBase solves this completely. Every comparison happens entirely within your browser. No data is ever uploaded, transmitted, or stored anywhere. The network tab stays completely silent during use. You can disable internet access entirely and the tool continues working perfectly.</p> <h2>How True Client-Side Processing Works</h2> <p>All comparison logic runs in your local JavaScript environment. The diff algorithms execute directly in your browser tab using only the content you pasted. When you close the page, everything disappears permanently. There are no cookies, no tracking pixels, and no analytics collecting usage data.</p> <p>This architecture means you can safely compare proprietary templates, internal administrative interfaces, financial dashboards, or any other sensitive markup. Security teams and compliance officers appreciate that no exceptions need to be made for using the tool.</p> <h2>Proof You Can Verify Yourself</h2> <p>Open the browser developer tools and watch the network panel while using the tool. You will see zero requests after the initial page load. Try it in airplane mode or with internet disconnected. Everything continues functioning normally. This is the ultimate proof that processing truly happens locally.</p> <p>The completely static deployment model reinforces this security. The site consists only of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files served from a content delivery network. There is no backend, no database, and no server-side code that could potentially access your content.</p> <p>For organizations with strict data handling policies, this client-side approach eliminates risk entirely. Teams can adopt the tool confidently knowing it meets even the most stringent security requirements without compromising on functionality or performance.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-jo8es1">Real privacy isn’t a marketing claim. It’s architecture you can verify with your own eyes.</p></article></div>');function z(d){var e=T();b("jo8es1",y=>{var o=S(),h=u(v(o),6);t(4),i(()=>l(h,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post7`)),g(()=>{f.title="Privacy & Security: 100% Client-Side Processing Explained • AxelBase Blog"}),n(y,o)});var a=r(e),m=r(a);t(4),s(a),t(2),s(e),i(()=>l(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),n(d,e)}export{z as component,B as universal};
