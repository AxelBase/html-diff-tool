Each serves different needs depending on the type of changes being reviewed and the reviewer’s preferences.</p> <p>The inline mode, also called line-by-line, presents a single unified view where added content appears in green and removed content in red, directly within the flow of the document. This format excels when you want to see the final result with changes clearly marked in context. It works particularly well for reviewing content updates, copy changes, or small structural modifications where understanding the overall flow matters most.</p> <h2>When Inline View Shines</h2> <p>Content teams and editors often prefer this view because it shows exactly how the final page will look with changes integrated. Writers can immediately see how new paragraphs or updated headings fit into the existing structure. Marketing teams reviewing campaign pages find it easier to focus on messaging rather than technical layout differences.</p> <p>In contrast, the side-by-side mode displays both versions simultaneously in parallel columns. This layout makes it instantly clear which parts existed only in the original, which are new, and which remain unchanged. Structural changes become dramatically more visible: moved sections, added containers, or reorganized navigation immediately stand out.</p> <h2>The Power of Direct Comparison</h2> <p>Developers and designers typically favor side-by-side view when working with templates or component libraries. When a card component moves from one section to another, this mode shows the exact origin and destination without any ambiguity. Attribute changes appear directly next to each other, making it simple to spot class additions, ID updates, or accessibility improvements.</p> <p>Many teams switch between both views depending on the task. Start with side-by-side to understand major structural shifts, then switch to inline to see how everything reads together. The tool remembers your preference, so you always land in the view that matches your workflow.</p> <p>Understanding these two perspectives transforms how effectively you can review HTML changes. What might look confusing in one mode often becomes perfectly clear in the other.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1apmzc4">The best reviewers master both views and know exactly when to use each.</p></article></div>');function D(h){var e=S();v("1apmzc4",m=>{var a=x(),g=w(y(a),6);t(4),n(()=>l(g,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post2`)),f(()=>{u.title="Line-by-Line vs Side-by-Side: Choosing the Right View • AxelBase Blog"}),s(m,a)});var i=o(e),p=o(i);t(4),r(i),t(2),r(e),n(()=>l(p,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),s(h,e)}export{D as component,B as universal};
