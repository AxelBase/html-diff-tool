A button becoming disabled, an image gaining a loading strategy, or a link receiving proper accessibility labels — these modifications are crucial but often invisible in traditional text-based diff tools.</p> <p>AxelBase treats attributes as first-class citizens during comparison. When the class list changes from button to button primary, when an ID is added for JavaScript targeting, or when aria-label text is updated for screen readers, these modifications receive special visual treatment that makes them impossible to miss.</p> <h2>Precision at the Attribute Level</h2> <p>The tool examines each attribute individually. Added attributes appear with a distinct background highlight, removed ones show clearly as deletions, and modified values display both old and new states. This granular approach means you never have to guess whether that important data-attribute was added, changed, or accidentally removed.</p> <p>For accessibility teams, this visibility is invaluable. Adding role equals dialog or aria-expanded equals true becomes immediately apparent. Design system maintainers can verify that components receive correct variant classes. Performance engineers can confirm that images now include loading equals lazy without digging through dense markup.</p> <h2>Context That Matters</h2> <p>Unlike tools that only show entire line changes, AxelBase displays attribute modifications inline with the element they belong to. You see exactly which button gained the disabled state or which navigation item received the active class. This context preservation dramatically reduces the cognitive load when reviewing complex changesets.</p> <p>The visual language is consistent: green for additions, red for removals, and a subtle highlight for modifications. Even when dozens of attributes change across many elements, patterns emerge quickly — perhaps a new design token system being applied, or accessibility attributes being standardized across a template.</p> <p>This attention to attribute-level detail transforms code review from a tedious chore into an efficient, insightful process. Teams ship more accessible, maintainable, and performant markup because important but subtle changes can no longer slip through unnoticed.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1al8b51">Great HTML reviews catch the changes that matter most — even when they’re invisible to users.</p></article></div>');function z(h){var e=A();y("1al8b51",m=>{var i=x(),g=u(b(i),6);t(4),n(()=>l(g,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post3`)),v(()=>{f.title="How Attribute Changes Are Detected and Highlighted • AxelBase Blog"}),s(m,i)});var a=r(e),p=r(a);t(4),o(a),t(2),o(e),n(()=>l(p,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),s(h,e)}export{z as component,M as universal};
