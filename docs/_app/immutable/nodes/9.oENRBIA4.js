Often you need to share those changes with stakeholders, document them in release notes, or include them in pull request descriptions. AxelBase makes this easy by generating properly structured, semantic HTML that can be pasted anywhere.</p> <p>When you click Copy Result, you don’t get a screenshot or styled text. You receive real HTML using the standard ins and del elements that represent insertions and deletions. These tags are part of the official HTML specification and are understood by browsers, email clients, and documentation platforms alike.</p> <h2>Ready for Real-World Use</h2> <p>The exported markup preserves all the visual highlighting while remaining completely valid. Added content appears wrapped in ins tags with green styling, removed content uses del tags with red strikethrough, and attribute changes are clearly marked. This means you can paste the result directly into GitHub comments, Notion pages, Confluence documents, or even Outlook emails and the formatting stays perfect.</p> <p>Technical writers love this feature because they can create beautiful before-and-after examples without learning complex tooling. Product managers include precise change descriptions in release announcements. Engineering leads embed clear visual diffs in architecture decision records.</p> <h2>More Than Just Pretty Output</h2> <p>Because the output uses semantic tags, it remains accessible to screen readers and works reliably across different platforms. The styling is minimal and inline, so it survives even strict email clients. The structure mirrors the original document, making it easy to understand context at a glance.</p> <p>Many teams have replaced lengthy written explanations with a single copied diff that shows exactly what changed. The universal compatibility means no one needs special software to view the changes correctly.</p> <p>This simple but powerful export capability turns a comparison tool into a complete communication solution. Changes become self-documenting, reviews become faster, and everyone stays perfectly aligned on what actually shipped.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1li990r">The best diffs don’t just help you understand change. They help you share it clearly.</p></article></div>');function B(d){var e=x();b("1li990r",h=>{var s=T(),u=g(f(s),6);t(4),r(()=>l(u,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post5`)),y(()=>{v.title="Exporting Diff Results as Clean, Semantic HTML • AxelBase Blog"}),n(h,s)});var a=i(e),m=i(a);t(4),o(a),t(2),o(e),r(()=>l(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),n(d,e)}export{B as component,L as universal};
